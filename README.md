## Description
Niffler - a black, fluffy creature with a long muzzle known from the Harry Potter novels.
Nifflers were looking for hidden treasures. The niffler application searches for public SSH keys in both standard locations and the custom locations option using the --anywhere parameter. The purpose of creating the application was to obtain information, especially about hidden public SSH keys.

> The niffler application is invoked from the root user because it requires access to user directories, and when invoked with the --anywhere parameter, to all system files.

## Installation

To install and run the project, you need to change the file permissions with `chmod +x niffler` and move it to the `/usr/bin/` directory. Here are the commands you need to run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamil-cias/niffler
cd niffler
chmod +x niffler
